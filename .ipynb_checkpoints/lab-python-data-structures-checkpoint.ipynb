    "## Exercise: Managing Customer Orders\n",
    "\n",
    "#As part of a business venture, you are starting an online store that sells various products. To ensure smooth operations, you need to develop a program that manages customer orders and inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Follow the steps below to complete the exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. Define a list called `products` that contains the following items: \"t-shirt\", \"mug\", \"hat\", \"book\", \"keychain\".\n",
    "    \n",
    "    products = [\"t-shirt\", \"mug\", \"hat\", \"book\", \"keychain\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Create an empty dictionary called `inventory`.\n",
    "inventory_products={}\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. Ask the user to input the quantity of each product available in the inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "product_inventory_ts=int(input('Please, insert the quantity for mug: '))\n",
    "product_inventory_mug=int(input('Please, insert the quantity for mug: '))\n",
    "product_inventory_hat=int(input('Please, insert the quantity for hat: '))\n",
    "product_inventory_book=int(input('Please, insert the quantity for mug: '))\n",
    "product_inventory_keychain=int(input('Please, insert the quantity for mug: '))\n",
    "\n",
    "#Use the product names from the `products` list as keys in the `inventory` dictionary and assign the respective quantities as values.\n",
    "#products_name={}\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. Create an empty set called `customer_orders`.\n",
    "customer_orders = set()\n",
    "#5. Ask the user to input the name of three products that a customer wants to order (from those in the products list, meaning three products out of \"t-shirt\", \"mug\", \"hat\", \"book\" or \"keychain\". Add each product name to the `customer_orders` set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#6. Print the products in the `customer_orders` set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#7. Calculate the following order statistics:\n",
    "   - Total Products Ordered: The total number of products in the `customer_orders` set.\n",
    "   - Percentage of Products Ordered: The percentage of products ordered compared to the total available products.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Store these statistics in a tuple called `order_status`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#8. Print the order statistics using the following format:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Order Statistics:\n",
    "   Total Products Ordered: <total_products_ordered>\n",
    "   Percentage of Products Ordered: <percentage_ordered>% \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#9. Update the inventory by subtracting 1 from the quantity of each product. Modify the `inventory` dictionary accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#10. Print the updated inventory, displaying the quantity of each product on separate lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Solve the exercise by implementing the steps using the Python concepts of lists, dictionaries, sets, and basic input/output operations. "
